        "question": "Who’s behind Peels?",
        "answer": "<p>Peels is a project led by <danny>Danny White</danny>, a product designer with 10 years experience working on products including Airbnb, ChatGPT, Kickstarter, and Facebook. He helped start the composting program at Pocket City Farms and previously built a traveller's guide to reducing food waste.</p><p>We want Peels to be around for the long haul, so have <opensource>open sourced</opensource> the project and welcome your contributions.</p>"
      },
      "howDifferent": {
        "question": "How is Peels different to ShareWaste?",
        "answer": "<p>ShareWaste was a precursor to Peels with a similar idea: connecting people locally to divert organic material from landfill. Sadly, ShareWaste shut down at the end of 2024.</p><p>Right now, we're just trying to fill the gap that ShareWaste left. You can think of Peels as a direct replacement for ShareWaste.</p><p>We've got plenty of other ideas in the pipeline, including general area guides for composting. Stay tuned for those.</p>"
      },
      "financialModel": {
        "question": "What’s the financial model? Are you non-profit?",
        "answer": "Peels is a non-commercial, community-led project. We may incorporate as a not-for-profit in the future and accept grant funding or sponsorships for further development, but we never intend to start charging for the service."

        "question": "I have a FOGO bin. Is community composting still relevant?",
        "answer": "Lucky you! Unfortunately, you’re in the minority. Most people don’t yet have access to kerbside compost collection. As long as that’s the case, there’ll be a need for community composting resources."

      "mapPrivacy": {
        "question": "I’m not comfortable putting my address on a map. Can I still participate?",
        "answer": "<p>Yes! We encourage folks with residential listings to ‘roughen’ their location to a nearby street corner or similar, and use a pseudonym if they feel more comfortable doing so.</p><p>Even if you choose to use your real name and upload a photo, only signed in Peels members can see those details.</p>"

It has information on how to contribute, plus some existing issues that could do with your eyes.</p> <p>Community organising is also a big part of getting Peels off the ground.

        "question": "How do I manage which emails I receive?",
        "answer": "<p>We only send emails that are necessary to keep Peels working. That includes one or two account-related emails, and emails to notify you whenever a fellow Peels member has sent you message.</p><p>Email notifications are required for listing hosts, as it means a prospective donor has enquired about dropping off scraps (or picking something up). Hosts who longer wish to receive emails can either hide their listing from the map (making it impossible for new donors to reach out) or delete their listing entirely (meaning previous donors can no longer message, either).</p><p>People without listings cannot be messaged (and thus emailed) unless they initiate contact with a host first.</p><p>Anyone can report or block individual Peels members via our messaging system. Blocking someone means they can no longer message or email you.</p>"
