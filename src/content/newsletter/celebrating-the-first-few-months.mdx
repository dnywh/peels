Hi there,

Welcome to the first issue of the Peels newsletter. As a reminder, <StrongLink href={siteConfig.url}>Peels</StrongLink> is a volunteer-led community
composting platform that launched in January this year.

We’ll be sending out updates 2–3 times a year, with a focus on how Peels supports community composting around the world.

## What’s new

Peels started in January with zero composters and zero publicity. Since then (thanks to folks like you), **we now have almost 300 listings** around the world.

  caption="A world map of Peels hosts, including far-flung places like Portugal, Hawaii, Alaska, Peru, Hungary, and Argentina."

Most of our hosts are in Australia and the USA, but we’re also seeing
compost communities spring up in New Zealand and the UK.

Below are just a few of our lovely hosts who happen have photos on their listings:

If you’re a Peels host and haven’t yet been contacted, thanks for your patience. Donor sign ups are growing steadily. In the meantime, **consider adding a photo to your listing**. Photos help donors feel more confident about reaching out.

### A deeper dive

If you want to hear more about Peels’ first few months and how it relates to community composting more broadly, check out <StrongLink href="https://loccal.org/2025/05/21/putting-community-composting-on-the-map-with-peels/" target="_blank">this blog post</StrongLink>
that I (Danny) recently wrote for LOCCAL.

I’d love to hear from you: **what are your ideas** for reaching more would-be composters? **What’s happening in your community** that Peels could better support?

## What’s next

Peels is growing but we can’t do it alone. We’re looking for fellow volunteers to help with **community outreach** and **technical contributions**.

### Community outreach

Many would-be compost donors and hosts simply haven’t heard about Peels. As a team of one (sometimes two), our outreach is limited.

**Please <EncodedEmailLink address={siteConfig.email.dw}>reach out</EncodedEmailLink> if you or someone you know can help promote Peels in your local area**. Whether it’s to councils, waste educators, or local networks, any help is appreciated. Our <StrongLink href={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/public/static/promo-kit.zip`}>promo kit</StrongLink> is also a good place to start.

### Technical contributions

Peels is now open source! That means **the <StrongLink href={siteConfig.repoUrl} target="_blank">source code is public</StrongLink>, documented, and ready for contributions**. We had our first community contribution just the other day from Hugo in Canada.

<NewsletterImage
  bucket="static/newsletter/1"
  filename="github-repo.png"
  alt="The Peels GitHub repository"
  width={1200 / 2}
  height={672 / 2}
  caption={
    <>
      Help us spread the word about Peels to your community, or get stuck in to{" "}
      <Link href={siteConfig.repoUrl} target="_blank">
        the code
      </Link>
      !
    </>
  }
/>

You don’t need to write code to contribute to the ‘product’. For example, we’re tackling <StrongLink href={`${siteConfig.repoUrl}/discussions/4`} target="\_blank">a tricky issue</StrongLink> with how people are using the donor listing category in unexpected ways. **Got ideas? <StrongLink href={`${siteConfig.repoUrl}/discussions`} target="\_blank">Join the discussion</StrongLink>!**

Finally, if you know someone who has yet to make a listing or hasn’t reached out about a drop-off, **please encourage them to do so**.

Thanks for reading. What would you like to see more (or less) of on Peels or in future newsletter issues? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Happy composting,  
Danny from Peels
