Hi there,

It’s the end of the year, and <StrongLink href={siteConfig.url}>Peels</StrongLink> is about to turn one. For those who were here from the start: thanks for making Peels what it is. For the newcomers: welcome!

Since the start of the year, 25+ local and state governments, industry bodies, and non-profits have pointed people to Peels, with plenty more mentions elsewhere. Here are some recents:

- <StrongLink href="https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/how-to-save-our-planet/id1648409844?i=1000732698117" target="_blank">How to Save Our Planet</StrongLink> included Peels in its composting episode.
- <StrongLink href="https://responsiblecafes.org/peels-replaces-sharewaste/" target="_blank">Responsible Cafes</StrongLink> featured Peels in a community composting guide.
- <StrongLink href="https://therot.substack.com/p/meet-danny-and-his-compost-app-peels" target="_blank">The Rot</StrongLink> interviewed me about how Peels started.

## Host spotlight

To help close out the year, here are a few newer hosts we’ve loved seeing join Peels, each doing community composting a little differently.

<StrongLink href={`${siteConfig.url}/map?listing=5vn8TsMrh3oC`} target="_blank">Kaicycle</StrongLink> joined Peels in mid-October and operates three compost drop-off sites in Wellington, New Zealand. Community-led composting plays an important role in New Zealand, where national kerbside composting faces <Link href="https://www.compostconnect.org/new-zealands-waste-policy-evolution/#:~:text=Mandatory%20kerbside%20composting%20for%20all%20urban%20areas" target="_blank">rollout challenges</Link>.

/>

Across the Pacific, we have <StrongLink href={`${siteConfig.url}/listings/ukUWLKVa0qar`} target="_blank">Esperanza’s Sanctuary</StrongLink>, a farm and community resource hub just outside of Palm Springs, California. Pick up an empty bucket, return it when it’s full, and they’ll show you how to compost.

Bringing things back down to the southern hemisphere, we have <StrongLink href={`${siteConfig.url}/listings/vmobuio1RAD5`} target="_blank">Power Neighbourhood House</StrongLink> in Melbourne, Australia. Their work centres on community inclusion, with composting and gardening playing a big role.

## Get involved

Many would-be compost donors and hosts simply haven’t heard about Peels. <EncodedEmailLink address={siteConfig.encodedEmail.dw}>Reach out</EncodedEmailLink> if you or someone you know can **help spread the word locally**.

If you know someone who hasn’t made a listing yet, **encourage them to create one**. If they’re a would-be donor, **encourage them to reach out and organise a drop-off**. This helps nearby hosts feel confident creating a listing, and it helps us make the case for more local government promotion.

Technical contributions are also welcome. If you can help with bugs (the software kind) or language translation, check out the <StrongLink href={`${siteConfig.repoUrl}/discussions`} target="_blank">discussions</StrongLink> and open <StrongLink href={`${siteConfig.repoUrl}/issues`} target="_blank">issues</StrongLink>.
