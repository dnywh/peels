    "Peels is built upon some great concepts, technology, and tooling, with some of the highlights mentioned below.",
};

## Technologies

Peels is made possible thanks to the free and open source software described below. Check out our <StrongLink href={`${siteConfig.repoUrl}/blob/main/package.json`} target="_blank">GitHub repository</StrongLink> for a full list of open source technologies used.

We’ve made Peels similarly <StrongLink href={`${siteConfig.repoUrl}?tab=readme-ov-file#forking-peels`} target="_blank">open source</StrongLink> to pay it forward and perhaps inspire other circular economy projects.

### Maps

<StrongLink href="http://protomaps.com" target="_blank">Protomaps</StrongLink> generously provides both the map tiles for Peels and a hosted API. We’re rendering those map tiles using <StrongLink href="https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/" target="_blank">React Map GL</StrongLink> and <StrongLink href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js" target="_blank">Maplibre GL JS</StrongLink>.

### Front-end

Peels is built on the open source React framework <StrongLink href="http://protomaps.com" target="_blank">Next.js</StrongLink>, and hosted on Vercel.

### Back-end

<StrongLink href="http://supabase.com" target="_blank">Supabase</StrongLink> powers all things authentication, database, and storage for Peels.

### Components

Peels relies on a few ‘headless’ React components under the hood, namely <StrongLink href="https://headlessui.com/" target="_blank">HeadlessUI</StrongLink> and <StrongLink href="https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives" target="_blank">Radix UI</StrongLink>. They provide a solid foundation for accessibility (and helped get us off the ground quickly). 

We don’t really use any custom components beyond the aforementioned primitive, headless, ones. The one major exception is the map drawer, based on the <StrongLink href="https://vaul.emilkowal.ski/" target="_blank">Vaul</StrongLink> drawer component.

### Icons

Some icons are derived from the <StrongLink href="https://lucide.dev/" target="_blank">Lucide</StrongLink> and <StrongLink href="https://heroicons.com/" target="_blank">Hero Icons</StrongLink> libraries. The rest have been drawn by hand.

## Concepts

It’d be remiss of us not to mention prior work done by folks to pave the way for something like Peels to not only exist, but be instantly understood by regular people using it for the first time. 

### ShareWaste

ShareWaste was a precursor to Peels with a similar idea: connecting people locally to divert organic material from landfill. We’re doing our best to continue the mission, in our own way.

### Mapping platforms

We take for granted how central mapping is to our everyday lives. Smart people developed interface paradigms (and satellites) that we use daily to find things in physical space around us.

Peels is a beneficiary of this work. We all know what pins on a map means. We know what will likely happen when we tap one, and how to jump between pins or pan around the world.

<StrongLink href="https://maphappenings.com" target="_blank">Map Happenings</StrongLink> does a great job describing the history of mapping platforms, in case you’d like to learn more.
