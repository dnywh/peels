Hi there,

Welcome to the first issue of the Peels newsletter. As a reminder, <Hyperlink href={siteConfig.url}>Peels</Hyperlink> is a volunteer-led community
composting platform that launched in January this year.

We’ll be sending out updates 2–3 times a year, with a focus on how Peels supports community composting around the world.

<NewsletterAside title="About this email">
  This is the shareable web version of the email newsletter sent out to
  subscribers. <Hyperlink href={siteConfig.url}>Join Peels</Hyperlink> to
  receive future issues.
</NewsletterAside>

## What’s new

Peels started in January with zero composters and zero publicity. Since then (thanks to folks like you), **we now have almost 300 listings** around the world.

Most of our hosts are in Australia and the USA, but we’re also seeing
compost communities spring up in New Zealand and the UK.

Below are just a few of our lovely hosts who happen have photos on their listings:

If you’re a Peels host and haven’t yet been contacted, thanks for your patience. Donor sign ups are growing steadily. In the meantime, **consider adding a photo to your listing**. Photos help donors feel more confident about reaching out.

### A deeper dive

If you want to hear more about Peels’ first few months and how it relates to community composting more broadly, check out <Hyperlink href="https://loccal.org/2025/05/06/the-loccal-loop-icaw-edition-may-2025-newsletter/" target="_blank">
this LOCCAL event</Hyperlink> that I (Danny) recently spoke at. You can skip to the 28 minute mark or, alternatively, flick through <Hyperlink href="https://loccal.org/2025/05/21/putting-community-composting-on-the-map-with-peels/" target="_blank">the written version</Hyperlink>.

I’d love to hear from you: **what are your ideas** for reaching more would-be composters? **What’s happening in your community** that Peels could better support?

## What’s next

Peels is growing but we can’t do it alone. We’re looking for fellow volunteers to help with **community outreach** and **technical contributions**.

## Community outreach

Many would-be compost donors and hosts simply haven’t heard about Peels. As a team of one (sometimes two), our outreach is limited.

**Please <EncodedEmailHyperlink address="ZGFubnlAcGVlbHMuYXBw">reach out</EncodedEmailHyperlink> if you or someone you know can help promote Peels in your local area**. Whether it’s to councils, waste educators, or local networks, any help is appreciated. Our <Hyperlink href={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/public/static/promo-kit.zip`}>promo kit</Hyperlink> is also a good place to start.

## Technical contributions

Peels is now open source! That means **the <Hyperlink href={siteConfig.repoUrl} target="_blank">source code is public</Hyperlink>, documented, and ready for contributions**. We had our first community contribution just the other day from Hugo in Canada.

<NewsletterImage

  width={472}

  caption={

      Help us spread the word about Peels to your community, or get stuck in to{" "}
      <Hyperlink href={siteConfig.repoUrl} target="_blank">
        the code
      </Hyperlink>
      !
    </>
  }
/>

You don’t need to write code to contribute to the ‘product’. For example, we’re tackling <Hyperlink href={`${siteConfig.repoUrl}/discussions/4`} target="\_blank">a tricky issue</Hyperlink> with how people are using the donor listing category in unexpected ways. **Got ideas? <Hyperlink href={`${siteConfig.repoUrl}/discussions`} target="\_blank">Join the discussion</Hyperlink>**!

---

Finally, if you know someone who has yet to make a listing or hasn’t reached out about a drop-off, **please encourage them to do so**.

Thanks for reading. What would you like to see more (or less) of on Peels or in future newsletter issues? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Happy composting,
Danny from Peels
