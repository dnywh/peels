# Privacy policy

_Last updated: 19th January 2025_

Peels is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and store your personal information, as well as your rights regarding that information. By using Peels, you agree to the practices described in this privacy policy.

## 1. What data we collect

When you use Peels, we collect the following types of information:

### 1.1 Personal information

We collect personal information (or Personally Identifiable Information, PII), which refers to any data that can identify you as an individual. This includes:

#### For all users

- First name (or a nickname).
- Email address.
- Messages you send and receive.
- Profile photo (optional).

#### For hosts

- Listing information (e.g., listing name, description, map coordinates).
- Listing photos (optional).
- External links (optional).

### 1.2 Cookies and authentication data

Peels uses essential cookies to manage user authentication and maintain user state. These cookies are stored on your browser and are not used for tracking or advertising purposes.

### 1.3 Technical and usage information

We also collect limited non-personally identifiable information to help maintain the security, functionality, and reliability of the platform. This includes:

- Browser type and version.
- Operating system.
- Access timestamps.
- Basic usage patterns (e.g., actions taken within the app).

This technical information helps us maintain platform security and stability but cannot be used to identify you personally.

## 2. How we use your data

We use your personal information to:

- Provide and improve the Peels platform.
- Facilitate connections between users (e.g., Donors and Hosts).
- Notify you of important updates or service changes (e.g., terms updates).
- Ensure the platform's security and functionality.

We may share anonymized, aggregated data (e.g., statistics about composting activity) with local councils, nonprofits, or similar organizations to promote sustainability and improve waste education. This data will never identify you personally.

## 3. Where your data is stored

Peels uses the following third-party services to store and process your data:

- **Supabase**: Hosts our database and file storage, with servers located in Sydney, Australia.
- **Vercel**: Hosts the Peels platform infrastructure and domain management, with servers located in the United States.
- **MapTiler**: Provides geolocation and mapping services for the Peels platform.
- **Resend**: Handles transactional emails, such as notifications and messages between users.

Data may be transferred to or processed in countries outside your location (e.g., the United States) due to the services we use (e.g., Vercel). We ensure such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws. We ensure these service providers meet industry standards for data protection and security.

## 4. Your rights

You have the following rights regarding your personal data:

1. **Access**: Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
2. **Rectification**: Request corrections to inaccurate or incomplete data.
3. **Erasure**: Request deletion of your personal data, subject to our legal obligations.
4. **Restriction**: Request that we limit processing of your personal data in certain situations.
5. **Portability**: Request your data in a portable format.
6. **Objection**: Object to how we process your personal data in specific situations.

Most of these rights can be exercised directly through your profile settings, where you can download a complete copy of your personal data, update your information, or delete your account. Please <EncodedEmailHyperlink address="c3VwcG9ydEBwZWVscy5hcHA=">contact us</EncodedEmailHyperlink> for other requests or assistance. Identity verification may be required for certain requests.

## 5. How long we keep your data

We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to provide the platform or as required by law. For example:

- Messages and listings are retained until deleted by the user or their account is terminated.
- Essential cookies expire after your session ends or as required for functionality.

Deleted data is removed from our systems within a reasonable timeframe, unless required for legal or security reasons.

## 6. Security of your data

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## 7. Changes to this policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes to our services or legal requirements. If significant changes are made, we will notify you via the platform or email. Continued use of Peels after the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.

## 8. Contact

Please <EncodedEmailHyperlink address="c3VwcG9ydEBwZWVscy5hcHA=">contact us</EncodedEmailHyperlink> if you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, or wish to exercise your rights.
