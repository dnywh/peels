By accessing or using Peels, you agree to these terms of use ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please discontinue using Peels immediately. These Terms are a legal agreement between you and Peels ("we," "us," "our") and govern your use of our platform, services, and content.

## 1. Who can use Peels

To use Peels, you must:

- Be at least 18 years old.
- Have full legal capacity to enter into this agreement.

By using Peels, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements.

## 2. Purpose of Peels

Peels is a platform designed to connect people who have food scraps to donate ("Donors") with those who can use them for composting or other sustainability projects ("Hosts"). We act as a connector and are not responsible for interactions, agreements, or disputes between users.

## 3. Your responsibilities

By using Peels, you agree to:

- Use the platform only for its intended purpose: connecting people for the exchange of food scraps.
- Provide accurate and truthful information when setting up your profile or creating listings.
- Respond to messages in a timely manner. Accounts that fail to engage in a reasonable timeframe may be suspended or terminated.
- Ensure any food scraps provided to Hosts are free of harmful or inappropriate materials (e.g., plastics, non-organic waste, hazardous items) and match the Host's stated requirements and guidelines.
- Not enter anyoneâ€™s private property without explicit consent from the property owner, even if a Host's listing is visible from the street.
- Follow all posted instructions and guidelines for drop-off locations.
- Refrain from using automated systems or bots that could overwhelm our servers or disrupt platform operations. This includes any software that sends more requests to our servers than a human user could reasonably generate through normal platform use.

You agree not to:

- Upload or share sexually explicit, illegal, offensive, or inappropriate content.
- Use Peels to engage in activities unrelated to its purpose.
- Use Peels' data (e.g., listings, user profiles, or other platform content) for commercial purposes without our written permission.
- Harass, threaten, or harm other users, or engage in abusive behavior.
- Violate any applicable laws or regulations while using the platform.

## 4. Community guidelines

We aim to foster a respectful and inclusive community. Please treat others with kindness and engage constructively. Violation of these guidelines may result in warnings, suspension, or termination of your account.

## 5. User-generated content

Peels hosts limited user-generated content, including:

- Names, nicknames, or other identifiers.
- Profile photos or avatars.
- Messaging content between users.
- Listings, including descriptions and coordinates.

By uploading this content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use it for the operation and improvement of the platform. You retain ownership of your content.

## 6. Limitation of liability

Peels is a platform to facilitate connections and does not guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of food scraps, listings, or user interactions. We are not liable for:

- Any disputes, damages, or losses arising from interactions between users.
- Any harm caused by food scraps exchanged through the platform.
- The accuracy of user-provided information.

By using Peels, you waive any right to pursue legal claims against us for disputes with other users or damages resulting from your use of the platform.

## 8. Changes to these terms

We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our services, legal requirements, or other important factors. If significant changes are made, we will notify you via the platform or email. Continued use of Peels after the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.
